## Asterisk Basics (continue)

6. Asterisk CLI Management:
o How do you reload SIP configuration without restarting the Asterisk service?
o What CLI commands can you use to monitor active SIP calls and registered peers?
o How do you check the status of voicemail users and their messages from the 
Asterisk CLI?

7. Asterisk System Monitoring:
o How do you monitor system performance, including RTP stream quality, for ongoing 
SIP calls in Asterisk?
o What are the common log files to check for call errors or failures, and how can you 
analyze them?

8. SIP Codec Management:
o How do you configure Asterisk to use a preferred codec (e.g., G.711, G.729) for 
specific peers?
o What steps would you take if Asterisk fails to negotiate the expected codec with a 
SIP client?

9. IVR and Voicemail Integration:
o How can you create an interactive voice response (IVR) system using ARI to 
dynamically control call flow based on user input?
o How do you manage voicemail for users and SIP peers within the Asterisk dial plan?

10. System Backup and Restore:
o What are the best practices for backing up the Asterisk configuration (including ARI 
apps) and restoring the system after a failure?

11. Scalability and Load Balancing:
o How can you scale Asterisk and ARI applications to handle high call volumes?
o What techniques can be used to load balance SIP traffic across multiple Asterisk 
servers
