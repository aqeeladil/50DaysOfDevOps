## Replication

1. Types of Replication: Describe the three main types of MySQL replication. What are they, 
and how do they differ from each other?

2. Benefits of Asynchronous Replication: What are the benefits of using asynchronous 
replication in MySQL? In what scenarios would this type of replication be advantageous?

3. Disadvantages of Asynchronous Replication: Discuss the disadvantages of 
asynchronous replication. What issues might arise from this type of setup?

4. Benefits of Synchronous Replication: What advantages does synchronous replication 
offer compared to asynchronous replication? When would you prefer to use synchronous 
replication?

5. Disadvantages of Synchronous Replication: What are the potential drawbacks of using 
synchronous replication in MySQL? How can this affect application performance?

6. Types of Replications in MySQL: Explain the differences between statement-based 
replication and row-based replication. When would you choose one over the other?

7. Setting Up Master-Slave Replication: Describe the steps to set up master-slave 
replication in MySQL on Ubuntu. What configurations are required on both the master and 
slave servers?

8. Configuring Replication Filters: How can you configure replication filters to control which 
databases or tables are replicated? Provide an example of how to exclude a specific 
database.

9. Using GTID for Replication: Explain the role of Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs) in 
MySQL replication. How do GTIDs simplify replication management?

10. Creating a Replication User: Write the SQL command to create a user for replication on 
the master server. What privileges should this user have

11. Monitoring Replication Status: What command would you use to check the status of 
replication on a slave server? What specific output should you look for?

12. Starting and Stopping Replication: Describe the commands used to start and stop 
replication on a MySQL slave server.

13. Changing the Master: How can you change the master server for an existing slave in 
MySQL replication? Describe the steps involved
