# Linux Directory Structure

## 1. Purpose of Key Directories in Linux

- **`/bin`**: Contains essential binary executables (commands) required for basic system operation, such as `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, and `cat`. These commands are available in both single-user mode and normal operation.
- **`/dev`**: Stores device files that represent hardware and virtual devices (e.g., `/dev/sda` for a hard disk, `/dev/null`, and `/dev/tty`).
- **`/etc`**: Holds configuration files for the system and applications (e.g., `/etc/passwd` for user accounts, `/etc/fstab` for filesystem mount points).
- **`/home`**: Stores user-specific files, configurations, and personal data. Each user gets a separate directory under `/home/username`.
- **`/lib`**: Contains shared libraries and kernel modules required by system binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- **`/proc`**: A virtual filesystem providing runtime system information (e.g., `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`). It does not store actual files but rather exposes kernel and process information dynamically.
- **`/tmp`**: A temporary storage location used by applications for temporary files. Files in `/tmp` are usually deleted on reboot.
- **`/usr`**: Contains user-installed programs, libraries, and documentation (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/share`). It is often mounted as read-only in multi-user systems.
- **`/var`**: Stores variable data like logs (`/var/log`), spool files (`/var/spool`), and databases (`/var/lib`).

## 2. Significance of `/var` Directory

The `/var` directory is crucial because it holds files that frequently change, such as logs, caches, and spool files. Its structure improves performance and stability by:

- Preventing excessive writes in `/` (root filesystem), reducing fragmentation.
- Allowing separation from system binaries, making backups and snapshots more efficient.
- Supporting large-scale applications (e.g., databases, web servers) that generate logs and temporary data.
- Ensuring logs persist after reboots for troubleshooting.

## 3. `/opt` vs. `/mnt`

### `/opt` (Optional Software Directory)
- Used for third-party, add-on, or proprietary applications not included in the default system installation (e.g., `/opt/google/chrome`).
- Typically used for software installed manually outside package managers.

### `/mnt` (Mount Directory)
- Used as a temporary mount point for manually mounted filesystems (e.g., mounting an external hard drive with `mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt`).
- Unlike `/opt`, it does not store application files permanently.

## 4. Uniqueness of `/proc` and Its Role in System Diagnostics

The `/proc` directory is a **virtual filesystem** that dynamically represents kernel and process information. Key differences:

- It does **not** store actual files but presents real-time system data.
- Files like `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`, and `/proc/[PID]` provide information on CPU, memory, and running processes.
- Used for debugging, performance monitoring, and retrieving system configuration.

### Importance:
- Tools like `top`, `ps`, and `vmstat` rely on `/proc` to retrieve system stats.
- `/proc/sys` allows tuning kernel parameters dynamically via `sysctl`.

## 5. Impact of Improper Management of `/root` and `/tmp`

### `/root` (Root Userâ€™s Home Directory)
- **Security Risks**: If misconfigured permissions allow unauthorized access, an attacker could compromise system-critical operations.
- **Data Loss**: Deleting files here without caution could make system recovery difficult.

### `/tmp` (Temporary Files Directory)
- **Security Risks**: If not properly restricted, malicious users can exploit it for **symlink attacks**, **race conditions**, or **privilege escalation**.
- **System Instability**: If `/tmp` fills up, applications relying on temporary storage may crash or fail.
- **Mitigation**: Use `noexec` and `nodev` mount options to prevent execution of malicious scripts in `/tmp`.
