## LVM2

1. Basic Concepts:
o What is LVM, and how does it differ from traditional partitioning methods? Explain 
the components of LVM (Physical Volumes, Volume Groups, and Logical Volumes).

2. Architecture
o Explain LVM architecture

3. Creating LVM Components:
o Describe the process of creating a new LVM setup. What commands would you use 
to initialize a physical volume, create a volume group, and add a logical volume?

4. Resizing Logical Volumes:
o How would you resize a logical volume in LVM? Discuss the commands needed to 
increase and decrease the size of a logical volume.

5. Creating Snapshots:
o Explain how to create a snapshot of a logical volume using LVM. Why might you 
want to create a snapshot, and how can it be useful for backups?

6. Monitoring LVM:
o What commands can you use to monitor the status of your LVM setup? Describe 
what information can be obtained from these commands.

7. Managing Volume Groups:
o How would you add a new physical volume to an existing volume group? What 
implications does this have for the logical volumes within that group?

8. Removing Logical Volumes:
o Explain the steps to safely remove a logical volume. What precautions should be 
taken to ensure that data is not lost?

9. LVM Benefits:
o Discuss the advantages of using LVM over standard partitioning, especially in 
environments with dynamic storage requirements.

10. File System Compatibility:
o What file systems are compatible with LVM, and are there any considerations to 
keep in mind when using LVM with specific file systems?

11. Recovery Scenarios
o If an LVM logical volume becomes corrupted, what steps can you take to recover 
data from that volume? What tools or methods are available for recovery?
