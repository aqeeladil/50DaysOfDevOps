# LVM2 (Logical Volume Manager 2)

## 1. Basic Concepts
### What is LVM?
LVM (Logical Volume Manager) is a storage management solution that allows for flexible disk space allocation, resizing, and management compared to traditional partitioning methods. Unlike static partitions, LVM provides dynamic resizing, snapshots, and efficient storage management.

### Components of LVM:
1. **Physical Volumes (PVs)**: Raw storage devices (e.g., disks, partitions) that are initialized for use with LVM.
2. **Volume Groups (VGs)**: A collection of physical volumes that form a single storage pool.
3. **Logical Volumes (LVs)**: Allocated storage from a volume group that functions like a traditional partition.

## 2. LVM Architecture
LVM is a layered architecture:
- **Block Devices (Physical Disks)**: The base storage units.
- **Physical Volume (PV)**: A layer that abstracts physical storage and assigns it to volume groups.
- **Volume Group (VG)**: A pool of storage composed of one or more PVs.
- **Logical Volume (LV)**: The user-defined partitions created from VGs.
- **File System**: The LV is formatted with a file system (e.g., ext4, xfs) and mounted for use.

## 3. Creating LVM Components
### Steps:
1. **Initialize a physical volume:**
   ```bash
   pvcreate /dev/sdX
   ```
2. **Create a volume group:**
   ```bash
   vgcreate my_vg /dev/sdX
   ```
3. **Create a logical volume:**
   ```bash
   lvcreate -L 10G -n my_lv my_vg
   ```
4. **Format and mount the LV:**
   ```bash
   mkfs.ext4 /dev/my_vg/my_lv
   mount /dev/my_vg/my_lv /mnt
   ```

---

## 4. Resizing Logical Volumes
### Increasing LV Size:
1. Extend the LV:
   ```bash
   lvextend -L +5G /dev/my_vg/my_lv
   ```
2. Resize the file system:
   ```bash
   resize2fs /dev/my_vg/my_lv
   ```

### Decreasing LV Size:
1. Unmount the LV:
   ```bash
   umount /dev/my_vg/my_lv
   ```
2. Resize the file system:
   ```bash
   resize2fs /dev/my_vg/my_lv 8G
   ```
3. Reduce the LV:
   ```bash
   lvreduce -L 8G /dev/my_vg/my_lv
   ```
4. Remount:
   ```bash
   mount /dev/my_vg/my_lv /mnt
   ```

## 5. Creating Snapshots
### Creating a snapshot:
```bash
lvcreate -L 2G -s -n my_lv_snap /dev/my_vg/my_lv
```

### Why use snapshots?
- Temporary backups before making changes.
- Testing software without affecting live data.
- Data recovery if changes need to be reverted.

---

## 6. Monitoring LVM
### Commands:
- View PVs: `pvdisplay`
- View VGs: `vgdisplay`
- View LVs: `lvdisplay`
- View disk space usage: `df -h`
- View active LVM processes: `lvs`

---

## 7. Managing Volume Groups
### Adding a new PV to an existing VG:
```bash
vgextend my_vg /dev/sdY
```
**Implications:**
- Increases the available storage in VG.
- LVs can be extended as needed.

---

## 8. Removing Logical Volumes
### Steps:
1. Unmount the LV:
   ```bash
   umount /dev/my_vg/my_lv
   ```
2. Remove the LV:
   ```bash
   lvremove /dev/my_vg/my_lv
   ```
3. Remove the VG (if needed):
   ```bash
   vgremove my_vg
   ```
4. Remove the PV:
   ```bash
   pvremove /dev/sdX
   ```
**Precautions:** Ensure data is backed up before removal.

## 9. LVM Benefits
- **Flexibility:** Resize partitions dynamically.
- **Snapshots:** Useful for backups and testing.
- **Efficient Storage Utilization:** No need to preallocate storage strictly.
- **Easier Management:** Extends over multiple disks.

---

## 10. File System Compatibility
LVM works with various file systems:
- **ext4** (widely used, supports resizing)
- **XFS** (recommended for large-scale deployments but cannot shrink)
- **Btrfs** (supports snapshots natively but has unique management tools)
- **NTFS** (limited use cases in Linux environments)

---

## 11. Recovery Scenarios
### Recovering from LVM corruption:
1. **Check LVM status:**
   ```bash
   lvscan
   ```
2. **Activate missing LVs:**
   ```bash
   vgchange -ay
   ```
3. **Check file system integrity:**
   ```bash
   fsck -y /dev/my_vg/my_lv
   ```
4. **Restore from a snapshot (if available):**
   ```bash
   lvconvert --merge /dev/my_vg/my_lv_snap
   ```
5. **Data recovery tools:**
   - `testdisk` (for partition recovery)
   - `ddrescue` (for disk imaging)
