## Networking Basics (continue)

11. Given the IP address 172.16.0.45/16, identify the network address, broadcast address, and 
the range of host IPs.

12. For the IP address 192.168.5.100/24, identify which subnet this address belongs to and 
whether it can communicate directly with the IP address 192.168.6.200/24 without a 
router.

13. Configure a device with a static IP address of 10.0.0.10 on a network with the subnet mask 
255.255.255.0. What will be the network address and broadcast address for this 
configuration?

14. Using a dynamic IP configuration, explain how a device obtains an IP address from the 
DHCP server. What information does the device receive from the DHCP server?

15. How does DNS resolve the domain name www.example.com into an IP address? Describe 
the process step by step.

16. Explain what would happen if the DNS server is unreachable when trying to access a 
website.

17. Design a subnetting plan for a company that requires 6 subnets with at least 30 hosts each. 
What will be the subnet mask and range of each subnet?

18. You have been given the IP address 192.168.50.0/25. Further divide this into two subnets. 
What are the new subnet masks and IP address ranges
