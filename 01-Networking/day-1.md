## Networking Basics

1. Explain the difference between static and dynamic IP addresses. In which scenarios would 
you prefer to use each type?

2. What potential issues can arise from using a static IP address on a large network?

3. Define the purpose of Class A, B, C, D, and E IP addresses.

4. Why are certain IP ranges reserved and not available for general use? Provide examples.

5. Explain the role of a subnet mask in an IP address.

6. What is the difference between a network address and a broadcast address in a subnet?

7. How does a router determine which subnet an IP packet should be sent to?

8. Explain the purpose of a firewall in a computer network.

9. You are given the IP address 192.168.10.0/24. Divide this address space into four subnets. 
What are the network addresses, broadcast addresses, and available host ranges for each 
subnet?

10. Create a subnet that supports 16 host IP addresses. Provide the subnet mask and the range 
of usable IP addresses.
