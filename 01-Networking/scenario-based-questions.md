## Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: IP Addressing and Subnetting**
You are tasked with setting up a small office network. The office has three departments: HR (10 devices), IT (15 devices), and Sales (20 devices). You have been given the IP address range `192.168.1.0/24`.  
- **Question 1:** How would you subnet this network to ensure each department has enough IP addresses?  
- **Question 2:** What subnet mask would you assign to each department?  
- **Question 3:** How many usable IP addresses will each subnet have?  

---

### **Scenario 2: Routing and Default Gateway**
A company has two networks: `192.168.1.0/24` and `192.168.2.0/24`. These networks are connected via a router.  
- **Question 1:** What is the purpose of the default gateway in this setup?  
- **Question 2:** If a device in `192.168.1.0/24` wants to send data to a device in `192.168.2.0/24`, how does the router facilitate this communication?  
- **Question 3:** What would happen if the router fails?  

---

### **Scenario 3: DNS Resolution**
A user reports that they cannot access `www.example.com` from their computer, but they can access the website using its IP address.  
- **Question 1:** What could be the possible cause of this issue?  
- **Question 2:** How would you troubleshoot this problem?  
- **Question 3:** What role does the DNS server play in this scenario?  

---

### **Scenario 4: Network Protocols**
A company is setting up a file-sharing system for its employees. They want to ensure secure and efficient file transfers.  
- **Question 1:** Which protocol would you recommend for secure file transfers (FTP, SFTP, or TFTP)? Why?  
- **Question 2:** What is the difference between TCP and UDP, and which one would be more suitable for this use case?  
- **Question 3:** How does HTTPS ensure secure communication compared to HTTP?  

---

### **Scenario 5: Network Devices**
You are setting up a network for a small business. The network includes 20 computers, a printer, and a server.  
- **Question 1:** What network device would you use to connect all the computers within the same network?  
- **Question 2:** If the business wants to connect to the internet, what additional device would you need?  
- **Question 3:** What is the difference between a hub and a switch, and which one would you recommend for this setup?  

---

### **Scenario 6: Troubleshooting Connectivity**
A user cannot connect to the internet, but other devices on the same network can.  
- **Question 1:** What steps would you take to diagnose the issue?  
- **Question 2:** How would you check if the issue is with the user's IP configuration?  
- **Question 3:** What command-line tools (e.g., `ping`, `ipconfig`, `tracert`) would you use to troubleshoot this problem?  

---

### **Scenario 7: Wireless Networking**
A company is setting up a wireless network for its employees. They want to ensure the network is secure and provides good coverage.  
- **Question 1:** What security protocol would you recommend for the wireless network (WEP, WPA, or WPA2)? Why?  
- **Question 2:** How would you prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to the network?  
- **Question 3:** What factors could affect the wireless signal strength, and how would you address them?  

---

### **Scenario 8: Network Address Translation (NAT)**
A small business has a single public IP address provided by their ISP but needs to connect multiple devices to the internet.  
- **Question 1:** How does NAT help in this situation?  
- **Question 2:** What is the difference between static NAT and dynamic NAT?  
- **Question 3:** What device typically performs NAT in a home or small office network?  

---

### **Scenario 9: VLANs**
A company wants to segment its network into different virtual LANs (VLANs) for security and performance reasons.  
- **Question 1:** What is the purpose of VLANs, and how do they improve network performance?  
- **Question 2:** How would you configure VLANs on a switch?  
- **Question 3:** What is trunking, and why is it important in a VLAN setup?  

---

### **Scenario 10: Firewalls and Security**
A company wants to protect its internal network from external threats.  
- **Question 1:** What is the role of a firewall in a network?  
- **Question 2:** What is the difference between a stateful and stateless firewall?  
- **Question 3:** How would you configure a firewall to allow only specific types of traffic (e.g., HTTP and HTTPS) into the network?
