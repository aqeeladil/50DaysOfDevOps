# **Presentation Layer of OSI Model**

## **Overview**
The **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)** of the **OSI model** is responsible for **data translation, encryption, and compression**. It ensures that data sent from the application layer of one system can be read by the application layer of another system, regardless of differences in data formats.

## **Key Functions of the Presentation Layer**

### 1. **Translation (Data Encoding & Decoding)**
- Converts data between different formats so that communication between systems using different encoding methods is possible.
- Example: Converting **EBCDIC (used in mainframes) to ASCII (used in modern systems).**

### 2. **Data Compression**
- Reduces the size of data to optimize bandwidth and improve transmission efficiency.
- Example: Compression algorithms like **Gzip, JPEG, MP3** reduce file sizes before transmission.

### 3. **Encryption & Decryption**
- Ensures data security by encrypting it before transmission and decrypting it upon reception.
- Example: **SSL/TLS encryption** in HTTPS ensures secure communication between web browsers and servers.

### 4. **Formatting & Syntax Handling**
- Ensures proper structuring of data formats such as **JSON, XML, HTML, GIF, PNG, MP4**.
- Example: A **web browser** interpreting an **HTML** page correctly.

## **Practical Scenario: Secure Online Banking Transaction**

### **Scenario: A User Logs into an Online Banking Website**

#### **Step 1: User Requests the Banking Website (Client-Side Processing)**
- The user enters **https://www.mybank.com** in their browser.
- The **browser** sends an **HTTPS request** to the banking server.

#### **Step 2: Encryption and Decryption (TLS/SSL)**
- The **Presentation Layer** encrypts the user’s credentials using **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**.
- The encrypted data is transmitted to the bank’s server securely.
- On the server side, the **Presentation Layer decrypts** the received data for authentication.

#### **Step 3: Data Formatting & Compression**
- The server sends a response in **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- If images or videos are part of the response, they are compressed using **JPEG, PNG, or MP4 formats** to reduce file size.
- The client-side **Presentation Layer** processes the compressed data and renders it properly in the browser.

#### **Step 4: Data Translation**
- The data may need to be converted from one format to another:
  - **If the banking system uses XML**, but the client needs JSON, the Presentation Layer **translates XML to JSON**.
  - Character encoding might be adjusted from **UTF-16 to UTF-8** if needed.

#### **Step 5: Secure Session Management**
- Session tokens and authentication data are **encrypted** to prevent unauthorized access.
- The user continues the transaction securely, with the **Presentation Layer ensuring all data is properly formatted and protected**.

## **Conclusion**
The **Presentation Layer** plays a vital role in ensuring data is in the correct format, compressed efficiently, and securely encrypted before transmission. In real-world applications like **online banking, video streaming, and secure file transfers**, this layer **enhances performance, ensures compatibility, and protects data integrity.**
