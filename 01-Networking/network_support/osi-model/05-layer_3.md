# **Network Layer (Layer 3) - Complete Guide**

The **Network Layer** (Layer 3 of the OSI model) is responsible for **routing, addressing, and forwarding data packets** across networks. It ensures end-to-end delivery of data by determining the best path for packet transmission.

---

## **Key Functions of the Network Layer**

1. **Logical Addressing (IP Addressing)**  
   - Assigns unique IP addresses to devices to identify them in a network.
   - Uses IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes.

2. **Routing**  
   - Determines the best path for data packets to reach the destination.
   - Uses routing algorithms and protocols such as OSPF, RIP, and BGP.

3. **Packet Forwarding**  
   - Transfers packets from source to destination based on routing decisions.

4. **Network Address Translation (NAT)**  
   - Modifies IP addresses in packet headers to allow private IPs to communicate over public networks.

5. **Filtering (Access Control)**  
   - Uses firewalls or ACLs to filter packets based on security policies.

6. **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**  
   - Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices in a network.

## **Practical Scenario - Office Network Setup**

### **Scenario:**  
A company has an office with 50 employees. Each employee needs internet access and internal communication. The network setup involves a **router, DHCP server, NAT, routing, and packet filtering**.

---

### **1. IP Addressing & DHCP**
Each device in the office needs a unique IP address. Instead of manually assigning IPs, a **DHCP Server** automates this.

#### **Process:**
1. A laptop connects to the office Wi-Fi and sends a DHCP Discover message (broadcast).
2. The DHCP server responds with an IP offer (e.g., 192.168.1.10).
3. The laptop requests the offered IP.
4. The DHCP server acknowledges, and the device gets an IP (e.g., `192.168.1.10/24`), subnet mask, gateway, and DNS.

#### **Outcome:**
- Employees can now communicate internally using assigned IPs.

---

### **2. Routing - Sending Data Across Networks**
The office network uses a **router** to connect to the internet and other branch offices.

#### **Routing Example:**
1. Employee A (IP: `192.168.1.10`) wants to send an email to a server on another branch (IP: `10.10.5.20`).
2. The packet reaches the **default gateway** (`192.168.1.1` - office router).
3. The router checks its **routing table** for the best path to `10.10.5.20`.
4. If a direct route exists, it forwards the packet; otherwise, it uses the default route to the internet.

#### **Routing Protocols Used:**
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)** – Simple distance-vector routing for small networks.
- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)** – Used for large networks, chooses the best path based on cost.
- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)** – Used by ISPs for internet-wide routing.

#### **Outcome:**
- Employees can access resources in different network segments.

---

### **3. NAT - Allowing Internet Access**
Office employees have **private IPs (192.168.1.x)**, but public websites require **public IPs**.

#### **How NAT Works:**
1. Employee A (IP: `192.168.1.10`) wants to visit `www.google.com`.
2. The router replaces `192.168.1.10` with the office’s public IP (`203.0.113.5`).
3. Google’s server responds to `203.0.113.5`.
4. The router translates it back to `192.168.1.10` and forwards it to the employee.

#### **Types of NAT:**
- **Static NAT** – Maps a private IP to a public IP permanently.
- **Dynamic NAT** – Assigns public IPs from a pool dynamically.
- **PAT (Port Address Translation)** – Multiple private IPs share a single public IP.

#### **Outcome:**
- Employees can browse the internet securely using NAT.

---

### **4. Packet Filtering - Security Control**
The company wants to block social media sites like Facebook and only allow work-related access.

#### **How Filtering Works (Using ACLs):**
1. The firewall/router applies **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**.
2. Rule Example:
   ```
   Deny TCP any host facebook.com eq 80
   Permit IP any any
   ```
3. If an employee tries to access Facebook, the request is blocked.
4. If they access an allowed website (e.g., a work-related tool), it is permitted.

#### **Outcome:**
- Enhanced network security and controlled internet usage.

## **Additional Concepts in the Network Layer**

### **1. IP Subnetting & CIDR**
- Divides networks into subnets to optimize IP usage.
- **Example:** HR (`192.168.1.0/26`), IT (`192.168.1.64/25`), Sales (`192.168.1.192/27`).

### **2. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**
- Used for **network troubleshooting** (ping, traceroute).
- **Example:** `ping www.google.com` checks connectivity.

### **3. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)**
- Resolves **IP to MAC addresses**.
- **Example:** Employee A (`192.168.1.10`) finds Employee B’s MAC via ARP request.

### **4. VPN (Virtual Private Network) & Tunneling**
- Secures **remote access** to office resources.
- **Example:** Remote employees use **IPSec VPN** to access internal servers.

### **5. MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)**
- **Faster routing** using labels instead of IP addresses.
- **Example:** ISPs use **MPLS** for efficient traffic routing.

### **6. QoS (Quality of Service)**
- **Prioritizes critical traffic** (VoIP over downloads).
- **Example:** **Video calls** get higher priority than file transfers.
